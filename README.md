# Sample Microservice Application

Stan's Robot Shop is a sample microservice application you can use as a sandbox to test and learn containerised application orchestration and monitoring techniques. It is not intended to be a comprehensive reference example of how to write a microservices application, although you will better understand some of those concepts by playing with Stan's Robot Shop. To be clear, the error handling is patchy and there is not any security built into the application.

You can get more detailed information from my [blog post](https://www.instana.com/blog/stans-robot-shop-sample-microservice-application/) about this sample microservice application.

This sample microservice application has been built using these technologies:
- NodeJS ([Express](http://expressjs.com/))
- Java ([Spring Boot](https://spring.io/))
- Python ([Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org))
- Golang
- PHP (Apache)
- MongoDB
- Redis
- MySQL ([Maxmind](http://www.maxmind.com) data)
- RabbitMQ
- Nginx
- AngularJS (1.x)

The various services in the sample application already include all required Instana components installed and configured. The Instana components provide automatic instrumentation for complete end to end [tracing](https://docs.instana.io/core_concepts/tracing/), as well as complete visibility into time series metrics for all the technologies.

To see the application performance results in the Instana dashboard, you will first need an Instana account. Don't worry a [trial account](https://instana.com/trial?utm_source=github&utm_medium=robot_shop) is free.
